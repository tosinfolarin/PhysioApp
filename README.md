# WaitLess Physio App


Welcome to the WaitLess Physio App, a physiotherapy application which provides users with the opportunity to access information that they would usually only access on their first contact with a physiotherapist after a referral from their GP or an FCP. This application offers information about more serious conditions to be aware of (Red flags). But also allows users to access exercises with progressions depending on their area of concern.
